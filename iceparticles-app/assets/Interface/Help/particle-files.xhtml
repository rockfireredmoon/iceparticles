        <h1>Particle Files</h1>
        <p>A <em>.particle</em> file contains one or more <strong>Particle Scripts</strong>. Each 
            script will contain at least one <em>Emitter</em>, and optionally any number of
            <em>Affectors</em>. </p>
        <a name="#open" id="open"><h2>Opening Existing Particle Files</h2></a>
        <img style="float: right;" src="particle-menu.png"/><p>Simply click on the <strong>Particles</strong> button at the top of the screen. This
            will list all of the <em>.particle</em> assets that are available in a menu. Then
            click on the file you wish to edit, and a new window will open containing the editor
            for this file.</p>
        <p>Particle files exist either on the server or locally on your computer. When
            you open a server file and later save it, you will be asked to give the
            file a new name, and then it will be stored locally. These files may then
            be integrated into the game. Server files appear in the menu coloured
            <strong>White</strong>, while local files will be <span style="color: green;"><strong>Green</strong></span>.</p>
        <p>Next, move on to <a href="particle-scripts.xhtml">Particle Scripts</a>.</p>
        <a name="#new" id="new"><h2>Creating A New Particle File</h2></a>
        <img style="float: left;" src="new-particle-file.png"/><p>Click on the <strong>Particles</strong>
                    button at the top of the screen to open the menu, then choose
                    <strong>New Particle File</strong>. You will be asked for the name of the file.
                    Just provide a name (no .particle suffix is need). The name must
                    not already exist either locally or on the server, and once created
                    the file will exist locally.</p>
        <a name="#delete" id="delete"><h2>Deleting A Particle File</h2></a>
        <img style="float: right;" src="delete-particle-file.png"/><p>At the bottom
            of the <em>Particle Editor Window</em> is a <strong>Delete</strong> button.
            Click on this and you will be asked to confirm the deletion. Click on <strong>Ok</strong>
        and the file will be deleted, and the current editor closed.</p>
