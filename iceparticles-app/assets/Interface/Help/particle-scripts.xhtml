         <img style="float: right;" src="selecting-scripts.png"/><p>When editing a 
             script file, all the scripts contained within it will be listed in top
             half of the script editor window.</p>
         <p>Each script has a checkbox next to it. Click to this to turn previewing
             of that script on an off.</p>
         <p>Note, it is currently only possible to edit one script file at a time. When
             switch to another script file, previews of all the current scripts will
             be turned off, and any unsaved changes will be discarded. Do not worry,
             you will be asked to confirm the action if this happens!</p>
         <a name="#new" id="new"><h2>Creating A New Script</h2></a>
        <img style="float: left;" src="new-script-button.png"/><p>Click on the <b>New Script</b>
            button at the very top of the editor window. You will be asked to provide
            a name for the script.</p>
        <img style="float: right;" src="new-script.png"/><p>Note, <em>Planet Forever</em> script names usually being with <strong>Par-Something</strong>.
            Please follow this convention.</p>

            First select the script you wish to delete by clicking it. The row
            will be highlighed in blue. Then at the top
            of the <em>Particle Editor Window</em> is a <strong>Delete</strong> button. 
            Click on this and you will be asked to confirm the deletion. Click on <strong>Ok</strong>
            and the script will be deleted, and any current previews of that script will
            be stopped.</p>
        <p>Alternatively, you can right click an individual script to show the script
            context menu, and click <b>Delete</b>.</p>
        <a name="#delete" id="clipboard"><h2>Copy And Paste</h2></a><p>You can copy
        each individual script to the system clipboard by right clicking it and
        chosing the <strong>Copy</strong> menu item. You may then paste this
        script text into any other external editor and make changes to the script
        directly.</p><p>When done, copy the changed script back into the clipboard, then
        use the <strong>Paste</strong> menu item to put the changes back in to the
        script file you are editing. The UI will be updated accordingly.</p>
